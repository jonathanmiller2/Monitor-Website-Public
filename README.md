# Monitor-Website-Public
A website to monitor the contents of a database, and display the data in useful ways. Unfortunately, I can't show off how glamorous it looked, as the database that this website monitored is long gone at time of writing.

The features of the website included:
* Colored cells displaying the strength of weights in the neural network it was monitoring
* Plot of outcomes vs. predictions given by the neural network
* Buttons to make different HTTP requests to the server
* A nicely designed title

### **To potential employers:**
The code in this project shows (some of) my capability as a full-stack developer. Though the website itself was simplistic, the basics that went into the project are the core of all web development. If you look through my code you will find the following skills:

* HTTP request sending/handling
* Ajax requests
* Data handling & representation
* Basic CSS
* Event-driven website programming
* Embedded JS
* Use of open-source packages in web development
* Website-database interaction
